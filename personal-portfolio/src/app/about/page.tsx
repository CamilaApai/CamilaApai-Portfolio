          I&rsquo;m a 22-year-old student. I&rsquo; was born in the beautiful
          city of Montevideo, Uruguay. My journey in the world of technology
          began a couple of years ago leading me to pursue a Software
          Development Degree at Brigham Young Universityâ€“Idaho, with an
          anticipated graduation in July 2024.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to my degree, I earned a Web and Computer Programming
          Certificate from BYU&ndash;Pathway Worldwide in December 2022. This
          certification has equipped me with proficiency in Python, HTML/CSS,
          Java, and JavaScript, highlighting my strong design and
          problem-solving skills. I pride myself on actively contributing to all
          phases of the software lifecycle, from planning and design to
          development and testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          My educational journey further expanded during the Youth to Program
          course from March 2023 to November 2023 at Ceibal in Montevideo. Here,
          I explored imperative and object-oriented programming, improving my
          computational thinking skills. Not only did I excel in my performance,
          but I also took on a leadership role by assisting peers and showcasing
          my ability for problem-solving and motivation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my professional pursuits, I enjoy a well-rounded lifestyle,
          finding joy in reading, outdoor activities, and video games. As I
          continue to evolve in my career, I&rsquo;m committed to lifelong
          learning and eagerly embrace new technologies, languages, and
          platforms. With my passion for software development and diverse skill
          set, I&rsquo;m prepared to keep learning and expanding my skill set.
